# Touchpoint Cadence Optimization

The frequency and timing of touchpoints significantly impact lead conversion. Too many contacts can overwhelm, while too few reduce engagement.

Recommended cadence:
- Initial contact within 24 hours of lead submission
- Follow-up at 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days
- Vary communication channels (email, phone, SMS)
- Pause outreach if lead requests to be contacted later
- Re-engage after 30 days with fresh value proposition

Optimized touchpoint cadences can increase conversion rates by 25-35% while maintaining positive customer experience.


Effective lead conversion requires strategic touchpoint timing. Initial contact within 24 hours of lead generation maximizes response rates. Follow a structured cadence: Day 1 (immediate), Day 3 (follow-up), Day 7 (value-add content), Day 14 (final offer). Vary communication channels (email, phone, SMS) based on lead preference and engagement level. Reduce frequency if lead shows disengagement signals. Increase urgency and provide compelling offers as lead ages. Track engagement metrics to optimize cadence per lead type.
