# Smoker-Specific Coaching and Programs

Smokers face higher premiums and may be more price-sensitive. Offer smoking cessation programs and incentives to reduce risk classification over time. Provide resources, support groups, and tracking tools for customers attempting to quit. Consider premium reductions or rebates after verified smoking cessation milestones (6 months, 1 year). Emphasize health benefits beyond insurance savings. Tailor communication to acknowledge the challenge while providing encouragement and practical support.
