# Agent Outreach Programs

Personalized agent outreach significantly reduces lapse rates, especially for high-value customers. Agents provide human touch and can address concerns that automated systems miss.

Key elements:
- Assign dedicated agents to at-risk policies
- Train agents on empathy and objection handling
- Use data-driven triggers (e.g., missed payment, policy anniversary)
- Follow up within 24-48 hours of initial contact

Agent-assisted retention programs typically achieve 15-25% higher retention rates compared to automated campaigns alone.
