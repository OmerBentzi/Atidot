# Grace Period Strategy

Insurance policies typically include a grace period during which customers can make late payments without immediate policy cancellation. For lapse prevention, proactively reaching out during this period is critical.

Best practices:
- Contact customers within 3 days of missed payment
- Offer flexible payment arrangements
- Emphasize policy value and protection continuity
- Document all communications for compliance

Early intervention during the grace period can prevent 60-70% of potential lapses.
