# Loyalty Discounts and Rewards

Long-term customers appreciate recognition for their loyalty. Discounts and rewards programs incentivize retention and reduce price sensitivity.

Implementation guidelines:
- Offer loyalty discounts based on tenure (e.g., 5% off after 3 years)
- Create tiered rewards programs (bronze, silver, gold)
- Provide referral bonuses for existing customers
- Highlight cumulative benefits and policy value over time

Loyalty programs can reduce lapse rates by 20-30% and increase customer lifetime value significantly.
