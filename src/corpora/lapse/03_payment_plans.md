# Payment Plan Options

Offering flexible payment plans can prevent lapses when customers face temporary financial difficulties. Payment plans demonstrate commitment to customer success.

Recommended approaches:
- Customize payment frequency (monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly)
- Extend payment deadlines for specific cases
- Offer partial payment options with balance deferral
- Provide automatic payment reminders and confirmations

Successful payment plan implementations reduce lapse rates by 30-40% among financially constrained customers.
