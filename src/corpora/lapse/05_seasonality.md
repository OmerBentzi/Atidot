# Seasonality and Timing Considerations

Insurance lapse patterns vary seasonally. Renewal periods during economic downturns or after major life events show higher lapse rates. Tailor retention efforts to align with seasonal patterns and customer life cycles. Target interventions before peak lapse periods (typically Q1 and Q4). Adjust messaging and incentives based on macroeconomic indicators and industry trends. Consider offering seasonal promotions or timing retention offers to coincide with customer financial cycles.
